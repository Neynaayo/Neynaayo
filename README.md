👋 Hi, I’m Siti Nur Husnina, a passionate and driven computer science student currently pursuing my diploma at UiTM. I have a keen interest in cyber security, web development, and innovative tech solutions.

🔍 I love exploring new technologies and continuously improving my skills through hands-on projects and real-world applications. My recent experience includes participating in the Technology Talent Exhibition Series 1 (TeTa), where I gained valuable insights into cyber security and teamwork.
